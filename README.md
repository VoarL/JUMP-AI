# JUMP-AI
Computer player for the classic JUMP game
This was created in 2015. Can be used and improved upon.
Please note that I made this program when I was in high school and coding style is not the best.
It has a few glitches but the AI components work in Visual Basic 6. 
Please contact me if you have any questions.
The classic game is also provided in the repository. Also note that some online components are provided and may not be working. 

Decription:
The JUMP game is a game in which you have to avoid the red obstacles to reach the blue square and then the green square. 
You can only make one move per turn.  
Movements are based on your velocity. 
Each turn you can increase or decrease your velocity.
You can skip you turn but if you have a velocity then you will still be moving. 
This is a 2 player turn based strategy game.
