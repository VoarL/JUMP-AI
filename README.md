## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the repo to play against an AI component in the original TBS Jump game.
How to play:
- The JUMP game is a game in which you must avoid the red obstacles to reach the blue square and then the green square. 
- You can only make one move per turn.  
- Movements are based on your velocity. 
- With each turn, you can increase or decrease your velocity.
- You can skip your turn, but you will still be moving if you have velocity. 
- This is a two-player turn-based strategy game.


## Features

- Computer player for the classic JUMP game
- This was created in 2015. Can be used and improved upon.
- Please note that I made this program when I was in Grade 11, and the coding style is not the best.
- It has a few glitches, but the AI components work in Visual Basic 6. 
- Please contact me if you have any questions.
- The classic game is also provided in the repository. 
- Some screenshots of the AI game have been provided.
