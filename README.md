# JUMP-AI
Computer player for the classic JUMP game
This was created in 2015. Can be used and improved upon.
Please note that I made this program when I was in high school, and the coding style is not the best.
It has a few glitches, but the AI components work in Visual Basic 6. 
Please contact me if you have any questions.
The classic game is also provided in the repository. 
Some screenshots of the AI game have been provided.


Description:
The JUMP game is a game in which you must avoid the red obstacles to reach the blue square and then the green square. 
You can only make one move per turn.  
Movements are based on your velocity. 
With each turn, you can increase or decrease your velocity.
You can skip your turn, but you will still be moving if you have velocity. 
This is a two-player turn-based strategy game.
